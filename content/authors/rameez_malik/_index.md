Rameez A. Malik is a PhD student in the School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering at UNSW Sydney, specialising in lunar navigation system design and optimisation. His research focuses on developing comprehensive frameworks for lunar navigation satellite systems (LNSS) with enhanced performance in critical regions such as the lunar south pole.

His work involves advanced constellation optimisation techniques, semi-analytical station-keeping models, and integration with Earth-based GPS systems for robust time synchronisation and accurate ephemeris generation. Rameez brings valuable experience in space flight dynamics and space operations, contributing to the advancement of cislunar space navigation capabilities.

His recent publication in Acta Astronautica demonstrates his expertise in multi-objective optimisation for space systems and his commitment to advancing lunar exploration technologies.
