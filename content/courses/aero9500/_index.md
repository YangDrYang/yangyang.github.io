## Course Description

This course provides an overview of satellite systems and their main applications, with a detailed introduction to the principles of orbital mechanics. Topics include orbit description and analysis, perturbations, orbital manoeuvres, interplanetary transfers, and launch systems.

## Course Aims

The course aims to furnish students with an understanding of the space segment of satellite and spacecraft systems, and their applications. Specific aims include:

1. Describe the history and current state of space flight.  
2. Describe spacecraft orbits — Keplerian and perturbed.  
3. Describe and calculate common spacecraft manoeuvres and associated propellant (∆V) costs.  
4. Describe and calculate the basics of rocket propulsion and spacecraft launch systems.  
5. Describe and calculate the mechanics of interplanetary travel.  
6. Demonstrate Systems Tool Kit (STK) software for satellite orbit analysis.

## Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs)

- **CLO1:** Explain the main applications of satellites and how they affect everyday life.  
- **CLO2:** Analyse spacecraft orbits and their perturbations, and recognise commonly employed satellite orbits.  
- **CLO3:** Compute ∆V and propellant requirements for orbital manoeuvres, interplanetary transfers, and launches.

## Learning and Teaching Technologies

- Moodle (Learning Management System)  
- Microsoft Teams
