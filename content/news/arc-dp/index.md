This project aims to provide theoretical underpinning to the development of new positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) techniques in cislunar space. The project expects to i) develop a framework for single-satellite Doppler positioning to be deployed in advance of PNT systems, ii) generate advances in autonomous on-board accurate positioning of lunar navigation satellites, and iii) develop a technique for time synchronisation of lunar PNT satellites. Expected outcomes include significantly improved lunar PNT accuracy, and algorithms that can be used by the Australian “roover” robotic lunar mission. Significant benefits include advancing knowledge and the development of novel methods to expand Australia’s capability in lunar PNT.
