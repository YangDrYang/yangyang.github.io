Rameez Malik's first journal paper, entitled "Lunar Navigation System Optimization for Targeted Coverage with Semi-Analytical Station Keeping Model and Earth-GPS Integration," has been accepted by Acta Astronautica.

This research presents a comprehensive multi-objective optimization framework for designing a Lunar Navigation Satellite System (LNSS) with enhanced performance in the lunar south pole region. The work integrates high-fidelity lunar orbit propagation with a semi-analytical station-keeping model and incorporates Earth GPS integrity for robust time synchronization and accurate ephemeris generation.

Congratulations to Rameez on this significant achievement! This publication represents an important contribution to lunar navigation systems research and supports future lunar exploration missions.
