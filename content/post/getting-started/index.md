Welcome to my academic website! I'm **Dr Yang Yang**, a Lecturer in Space Engineering at UNSW Sydney, specialising in astrodynamics, space navigation, and space situational awareness.

## My Research Focus

My research centres on developing advanced techniques for:

- **Orbit Determination**: Creating robust algorithms for precise spacecraft tracking
- **Space Navigation**: Advancing GNSS-based and autonomous navigation systems
- **Space Situational Awareness**: Improving our ability to monitor and track space objects
- **Estimation Theory**: Developing novel filtering techniques like the HOUSE (Higher-Order Unscented Kalman Estimator)

## Recent Highlights

- Published breakthrough research on **square-root higher-order unscented estimators** in IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems
- Conducting international collaborations with institutions in South Korea and other countries
- Teaching advanced courses in space engineering (AERO9500, AERO9610)
- Leading workshops on CubeSat technology and space navigation

## What You'll Find Here

This website showcases my:

- **Research Projects**: From lunar navigation architectures to space object characterization
- **Publications**: Peer-reviewed articles and conference papers
- **Teaching**: Course materials and educational resources
- **Professional Activities**: Workshops, talks, and international collaborations

## Get in Touch

I'm always interested in collaborating on space engineering challenges. Whether you're a student, researcher, or industry professional, feel free to [contact me](/#contact) to discuss potential opportunities.
