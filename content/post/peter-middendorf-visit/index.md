We were delighted to welcome Prof. Dr.-Ing. Peter Middendorf Rektor (Vice-Chancellor) of the University of Stuttgart, to the UNSW Optical Observatory on the rooftop of K17 at our Kensington campus.

Together with my colleague Michael Ashley and many students, we are modernising and automating this unique piece of physics heritage to enable space object tracking and characterisation — contributing to global efforts in tackling the space debris challenge.
