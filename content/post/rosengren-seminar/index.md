## Abstract

The cislunar xGEO region, stretching from just beyond geosynchronous orbit to well past the Moon, is rapidly becoming a focal point for science, exploration, commercial activity, and national security. Yet the dynamics that govern this volume are fundamentally different from the weakly perturbed Keplerian orbits that underpin traditional space surveillance.

Dr. Rosengren outlined a multiscale astrodynamical framework for modelling, monitoring, and ultimately enabling sustainable activity in this regime. Using Hamiltonian perturbation theory and restricted multi-body dynamics, the approach maps the web of lunar mean-motion and secular resonances that structure cislunar phase space, quantifies their broadened widths, and identifies both highly stable "graveyard" zones and strongly chaotic transport regions.

Heteroclinic transport networks linking interior and exterior resonances through Earth–Moon libration-point manifolds expose natural ballistic corridors for fuel-free transfers and for the migration of space debris and lunar ejecta. These dynamical structures were illustrated using high-fidelity ephemerides of missions such as TESS, IBEX, and Spektr-R, highlighting their direct operational relevance.

The talk also discussed a Gaussian-mixture "dynamical coherency gate" for recovering consistent long-arc trajectories from sparse tracking data, a curated organization of xGEO and cislunar objects by resonant and secular behavior, and MEGNO-based stability cartographies of the Earth–Moon Hill sphere. Dr. Rosengren emphasized how these multiscale tools can inform future space-domain awareness architectures, sensor-tasking strategies, and responsible end-of-life disposal policies that support the long-term safety and sustainability of this increasingly active cislunar environment.
