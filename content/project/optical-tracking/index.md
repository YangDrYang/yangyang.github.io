Optical tracking is a powerful technique for monitoring satellites and space debris using ground-based telescopes. Our team at UNSW has developed advanced algorithms for image processing and orbit determination.

## Project Highlights

- Developed a custom tracking pipeline for faint objects.
- Collaborated with the UNSW School of Physics for telescope access.
- Published results in leading journals.

## Observatory Automation and Remote Control

UG Tejas Margapuram has done a great job automating the UNSW Observatory for his thesis project. You can view his presentation slides here:
