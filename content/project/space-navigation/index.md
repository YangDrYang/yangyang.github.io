<!-- ## Overview

This project focuses on developing robust navigation systems for lunar missions, addressing the unique challenges of operating in the lunar environment where traditional Earth-based navigation systems are unavailable or unreliable.

## Research Objectives

- **Autonomous Navigation**: Design self-reliant navigation systems for lunar rovers and landers
- **Multi-GNSS Integration**: Leverage multiple satellite constellations for enhanced positioning accuracy
- **Fault-Tolerant Algorithms**: Develop robust estimation techniques that maintain performance under challenging conditions
- **Real-time Implementation**: Create computationally efficient algorithms suitable for space-qualified hardware

## Key Innovations

### Advanced Filtering Techniques
Our team has developed novel implementation of Higher-Order Unscented Kalman Estimators (HOUSE) specifically adapted for lunar navigation scenarios, providing superior performance compared to traditional filtering methods.

### Multi-Sensor Fusion
Integration of various sensor modalities including:
- GNSS receivers optimised for lunar operations
- Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)
- Visual odometry systems
- Laser altimeters

### Lunar-Specific Challenges Addressed
- **Signal Availability**: Limited GNSS coverage in lunar polar regions
- **Environmental Factors**: Extreme temperature variations and radiation exposure
- **Communication Delays**: Earth-Moon communication latency considerations
- **Terrain Navigation**: Advanced algorithms for crater-rich lunar surface

## Applications

This research has direct applications for:
- Future lunar exploration missions
- Mars and deep space navigation
- Earth-based autonomous vehicle navigation
- Search and rescue operations in GNSS-denied environments

## Collaborations

This project involves international collaborations with research institutions in South Korea and participation in global space navigation initiatives.

## Current Status

The project is actively developing prototype systems and conducting simulation studies to validate the proposed navigation architectures. Field testing with terrestrial analogs is planned for the next phase. -->
