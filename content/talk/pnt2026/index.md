**Title:** GNSS Based Orbit Determination of Lunar Navigation Satellite System

### Abstract

The development of an indigenous Lunar Navigation Satellite System (LNSS) is a critical enabler for sustained lunar presence and autonomous operations supporting future lunar base architectures. The performance of such a system is fundamentally dependent on the accuracy of the LNSS satellite ephemerides and clock synchronization. Errors in the estimated ephemerides or clock synchronization directly propagate into user positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) solutions, thereby degrading service integrity. Conventional ground-based orbit determination relies on Earth-based tracking networks, which are limited by geometric constraints, intermittent visibility, and communication gaps, making continuous and accurate ephemeris computation challenging for lunar satellites.

To overcome these limitations, this study investigates the feasibility of exploiting Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) sidelobe signals for LNSS precise orbit determination under various sensitivity bounds. Although the main-lobe coverage of GNSS constellations does not extend to lunar distances, several studies and in-flight missions have demonstrated detectable GNSS sidelobe signals in the cislunar region. By leveraging these weak but persistent signals, LNSS spacecraft can perform autonomous or hybrid orbit determination independent of continuous Earth-based tracking, thereby enhancing orbit recovery capability.

The results demonstrate that GNSS-based precise orbit determination enables accurate and continuous orbit recovery for LNSS spacecraft, significantly improving ephemerides precision in the absence of constant ground-based visibility. The proposed framework establishes a robust methodology for autonomous, high-accuracy orbit determination of LNSS constellations, contributing to the realization of a sustainable and resilient lunar navigation infrastructure.
